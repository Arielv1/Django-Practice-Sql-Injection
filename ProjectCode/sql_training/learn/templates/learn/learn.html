<h3>What is SQL Injection</h3>
<p>SQL Injection, also known as SQLI, is a common attack vector that uses malicious SQL code execution for backend database manipulation.</p>
<h2>What are SQL queries</h2>
<p>SQL is a standardized language used to access and manipulate databases to build customizable data views for each user.
    SQL queries are used to execute commands, such as data retrieval, updates, and record removal. Different SQL elements implement these tasks, e.g.
    , queries using the SELECT statement to retrieve data, based on user-provided parameters.</p>
<pre>SELECT ItemName, ItemDescription
FROM Items
WHERE ItemNumber = ItemNumber</pre>
<p>
    The commands are different for each database for example:
    Using postgre database you will need to do this command to get the name of the database:Select current_database()</p>
<p> Using MySQL database will be this command: Select database()</p>
<p>
    For more details regarding general SQL commands see references at the bottom of the page.

<h2>Types of SQL Injection</h2>
<p> SQL Injections typically fall under three categories: In-band SQLi (Classic),
    Blind SQL injection and Out-of-band SQL injection.<br>
    You can classify SQL injections types based on the methods they use to access backend.
    <br><br>For useful SQL Injection commands for various databases see:

</p>
<h3><strong>1. In-Band SQL Injection</strong></h3>
<p>The attacker uses the same channel of communication to launch their attacks and to gather their results.
   <br>In-band SQLiâ€™s simplicity and efficiency make it one of the most common types of SQLi attack.
    <br>See:
    <a href="{% url 'inband' %}" target="_blank">Examples for in-band injections</a>
</p>

<h3><strong>2. Blind SQL Injection</strong></h3>
<p> The attacker sends data payloads to the server and observes the response and behavior of the server to learn more about its structure.
    This method is called blind SQL injection because the data is not transferred from the website database to the attacker,
    thus the attacker cannot see information about the attack in-band

</p>

<h3><strong>3. Out-band SQL injection</strong></h3>
<p>The attacker uses a different channel of communication to launch their attacks and to gather their results.</p>
<p> This attack is less common because it depends on features being enabled on the database server </p>

<h3><strong>SQL Injection prevention and mitigation</strong></h3>

Option 1: Use of Prepared Statements (with Parameterized Queries)<br>
Option 2: Use of Stored Procedures<br>
Option 3: Whitelist Input Validation<br>
Option 4: Escaping All User-Supplied Input<br>
Option 5: Using external applications.<br><br>
<h4><strong>Prepared Statements </strong></h4>
<p> These are SQL statements that are sent to and parsed by the database server separately from any parameters.</p>
<p> The Query sent to server before the data input. and only when the execute happens it add up to the query.
    Which means that attacker cant alter the database.
    This methods cannot used on Dynamic queries where the query using input on field names or dynamic table names.
    and sometimes can be slower compare to other approaches.</p>

<h4><strong> Stored Procedures </strong></h4>
<p> The difference between prepared statements and stored procedures is
    that the SQL code for a stored procedure is defined and stored in the database itself, and then called from the application
    Stored Procedures also should be check which privileges they using sometimes it can be admin rule
    which you prefer to avoid it..</p>
<h4><strong>Whitelist Input Validation </strong></h4>
<p> Check the user input on specific list of options that should be valid.
    This option is good on Dynamic Query when Prepared Statement cant be used.</p>
<h4><strong>Escaping All User-Supplied Input </strong></h4>
<p> This technique should only be used as a last resort,
    This method is to escape special characters so the sql statement will not get alter by attacker
    using special character like. ' or ".  </p>
<h4><strong>Using external applications </strong></h4>
<p> Just to let you know readers there is more options. like Web application firewalls.</p>
<h4><strong> Least Privilege </strong></h4>
<p> Each database accounts should have least Privileges
    Make sure what the accounts need to do and let them only those right access
    Good thing is to create databases group with specific access to the things you want to let the user do</p>
