<h4>In-Band (Classic) SQL Injections</h4>


<body>
    <p>
        In-Band, also known as 'Classic' SQL Injection are performed
        by running SQL commands on the same interface and communication
        that is used to interact with the database.
        <br><br>
        For example, assume a login interface where the user needs to enter
        his username and a password - The attack will use those two text fields
        for his injection attemps.
    </p>

        <h4>1. Base Example</h4>

        Let's continue with our example of login:
        <br>Assume we have two attributes
        <span class="text text-success">username</span> and <span class="text text-success">password</span>.
        <br>Lets further assume that we know the table that user data is stored <span class="text text-success">db_users</span>.
        <br>If we make another outrages assumption that we know how the SQL commands looks like:
        <br><br>
        <div class="alert alert-primary">
            <pre>SELECT * FROM db_users WHERE first_name LIKE input1 and password LIKE input2</pre>
        </div>

        Where <span class="text text-success">input1</span> and <span class="text text-success">input2</span> are the identifiers of both text fields.

        <br><br>The initial approach should be trying to abuse the commands of the SQL
        languages against it - for this example we can abuse the wildcard: <span class="text text-success">%</span>
        If behind the scenes there's no input checking or validation simply
        entering <span class="text text-success">%</span> for both input fields will return all the users in the database.
        <br>
        <p>
            <form method="POST">
                  {% csrf_token %}
                <p>
                    <h6>Given the table <span class="text text-success">db_users</span>, please retrieve all of the users</h6>
                    <label>Username:</label>
                    <input type="text" name="input1">
                    <br>
                    <label>Password:</label>
                    <input type="text" name="input2">
                </p>
                <button type="submit">Search</button>
            </form>

        {% if num_resulted_items == num_items %}
            <br>
            <div class="alert alert-success">
                <pre>Success! You've Got The Right Answer!</pre>
            </div>
        {% endif %}

        {% if result %}
            <table class="table table-warning">
                <tr>
                    <th class="font-weight-bold text-primary">Username</th>
                    <th class="font-weight-bold text-primary">Password</th>

                </tr>

                {% for entry in result %}
                 <tr>
                     <td class="text-danger">{{entry.0}}</td>
                     <td class="text-danger">{{entry.1}}</td>
                 </tr>
                {% endfor %}
            </table>
        {% endif %}

        </p>
    <hr class="divider">
    <h4>2. Unions And Comments</h4>
    <h6>Another approach to solve the same problem is using the <span class="text text-success">UNION</span> function:</h6>
        <h6>We'll insert dummy data in the input fields and use the <span class="text text-success">UNION</span> keyword in the
        <span class="text text-success">passwords</span> input field.</h6>
        <h6>Note: Whether the dummy data we insert actually exists in the database or not is irrelevant.
        <br>So the injection will look like this:</h6>

        <div class="alert alert-primary">
            <pre>Username: a</pre>
            <pre>Password: b' UNION SELECT * from db_users ;--</pre>
        </div>

        <h6>This will be translated as the following SQL query:</h6>
        <div class="alert alert-primary">
            <pre class="text-bold">SELECT * FROM db_users <br>WHERE username LIKE 'a' and password LIKE 'b' UNION SELECT * from db_users ;--'</pre>
        </div>
        <h6>What's happening here? We're inserting dummy data  <span class="text text-success">a, b</span> into the input fields then run another
        SQL query through <span class="text text-success">UNION</span> to get all the User entries from the database.</h6>
        <h6>Note: We use  <span class="text text-success">b'</span> since the SQL query uses the  <span class="text text-success">LIKE</span> command on strings and chars.
        As a result we must close the char tag ('') ourselves, enter the <span class="text text-success">UNION</span> command and in order to execute the query
        without errors we add the <span class="text text-success">;--</span> signs which means the rest of the query is a comment so it won't be executed.</h6>
