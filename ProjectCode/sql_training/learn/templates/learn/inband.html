<h4>In-Band (Classic) SQL Injections</h4>


<div>
    <p>
        In-Band, also known as 'Classic' SQL Injection are performed
        by running SQL commands on the same interface and communication
        that is used to interact with the database.
        <br><br>
        For example, assume a login interface where the user needs to enter
        his username and a password - The attack will use those two text fields
        for his injection attemps.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        <h4>1. Base Example</h4>
        <p>
            <label>Username:</label>
            <input type="text" name="input1">
                <br>
            <label>Password:</label>
            <input type="text" name="intpu2">
        </p>
        Let's continue with our example of login:
        <br>Assume we have two attributes 'username' and 'password'
        <br>Lets further assume that we know the table that user
        data is stored 'db_users'
        <br>If we make another outrages assumption that we know
            how the SQL commands looks like:
            <br><br>
            <h6 class="text-success">SELECT * FROM db_users WHERE first_name LIKE input1 and password LIKE input2</h6>
            Where input1 and input2 are the identifiers of both text fields.

            <br><br>The initial approach should be trying to abuse the commands of the SQL
            languages against it - for this example we can abuse the wildcard: '%'
            If behind the scenes there's no input checking or validation simply
            entering '%' for both input fields will return all the users in the database.
